## Virus Check and Security

The project includes screenshots and links to help you inspect the repository and its files yourself. Please do your own checks before running any downloaded software.

### Virus-scan screenshots

### Check it yourself

- **For the whole repository:** [ScanRepo — Spotify-Craft-MC-Mod](https://www.scanrepo.dev/scan/github/CapitalistEnemy1/Spotify-Craft-MC-Mod)
- **For individual files:** [Upload a file to VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
- **Inspect the build workflow:** [GitHub Actions — build.yml](https://github.com/CapitalistEnemy1/Spotify-Craft-MC-Mod/actions/workflows/build.yml)
- **Review the source code:** [Spotify-Craft-MC-Mod on GitHub](https://github.com/CapitalistEnemy1/Spotify-Craft-MC-Mod)

### Why does the batch file show an 8% detection score?

The explanation provided by the project maintainer is that the batch file is used to build the mod from source after the repository is updated, and is not included in the mod itself. You can inspect the [build workflow](https://github.com/CapitalistEnemy1/Spotify-Craft-MC-Mod/actions/workflows/build.yml) and submit the batch file to VirusTotal or another scanner to review the results yourself.

**Important:** A detection percentage alone cannot prove that a file is malicious or harmless. Antivirus tools can produce false positives, and a clean scan does not guarantee that software is safe. Review the source code and scan results yourself, and only run files you trust.

Remember: check files before running them and stay safe online — click clever, click safe.
